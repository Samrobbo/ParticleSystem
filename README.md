# ParticleSystem

This project was developed for the COMP37111 Particle System Graphical Coursework, for the University of Manchester.

The key aspect of this was to utilise single point features in OpenGL, creating a graphical simulation that adhered to the laws of motion, all without drawing polygons or models on screen.
